> [!NOTE]
> - Ableton Live has two main modes of operation: Session and Arrangement. In Session mode, you can freely start and stop sections of music, called clips, and combine them into different scenes. This is ideal for improvisation and live performance. In Arrangement mode, you can arrange your clips on a timeline and create a linear track structure. This is handy for detailed processing and final mixing.
> - Ableton Live gives you a wide range of tools for creating a variety of sounds. You can use synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, guitar and bass emulators, and external audio sources. You can also add a variety of effects to your tracks, such as reverb, duel, chorus, filters, distortion, and more. You can control instrument and effect parameters using mouse, keyboard or MIDI controller.
> - Ableton Live also lets you record your own sounds using a microphone or line input. You can trim, chop, transpose, tempo, and tone your audio files. You can use the warping feature to synchronize your audio with the tempo of your project or to create interesting rhythmic effects. You can also convert audio to MIDI for further editing or sound replacement.
